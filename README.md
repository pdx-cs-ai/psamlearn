# psamlearn: machine learning on spam instances
Bart Massey

These packages are a class demo of various supervised
machine learning algorithms in both Python and Rust. They
are intended to operate on a corpus of instances from the
ancient PSAM ham/spam machine learning data. See the various
subdirectories for `README` files describing them.
